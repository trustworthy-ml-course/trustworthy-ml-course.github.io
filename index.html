		  <strong>This is not the right course to learn ML and/or deep learning</strong>. If you are taking this course to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and/or deep learning, you are in the <b>wrong</b> course and I ask that you consider dropping the course to give a chance to others to enroll in this course. This course is about  recent research on computer security and privacy as it applies to machine learning and deep learning. If you have not completed a course on neural networks before and/or are not comfortable reading research papers, you will not be able to follow this course. Please reach out to the instructor by email if you have any questions about the content of the course.

		<h4>Description</h4>

            <p>This course introduces students to the broad and emerging notion of trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Beginning with a hands-on introduction to the basics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and modeling, it will cover three broad areas of trustworthiness in AI. In the first area of robustness, the course will introduce students to the AI threat landscape focusing on training data poisoning, model evasion, privacy-sensitive data inference, model stealing/extraction, and threats to safe deployment of AI.  In the second area of transparency, students will be introduced to frameworks used to interpret/explain AI modelâ€™s decisions.   In the third area of accountability, students will learn methods and tools for reducing bias and ethical pitfalls when AI models are deployed in high-stakes application domains. The course concludes with a broader take on AI trustworthiness by studying the dynamics among the three broad AI trustworthiness desirables. The course will be taught in a predominantly project-based setting to allow students gain hands-on experience beyond conceptual understanding.</p>

	    <p>While prior knowledge of machine learning is not required, it will be a plus. To level the ground for everyone, the course will kick-off with a ML crash course just enough to understand subsequent material. Students are expected to have proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g., Python, C/C++, Java). Knowledge of data structures such as trees and graphs would be a plus.</p>
